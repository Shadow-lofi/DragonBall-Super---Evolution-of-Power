        <h2>Character Backstories</h2>
        <h3>Goku</h3>
        <hr
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>
              In Dragon Ball Super, Son Goku, the Saiyan warrior raised on Earth, serves as the main protagonist, constantly training to challenge the strongest opponents while protecting the universe. His personality remains energetic, kindhearted, and pure of heart, inherited from his mother Gine, with a carefree, pacifist nature that spares enemies when possible and believes in their potential for change. However, his love for combat often leads to recklessness, as he prioritizes thrilling battles over caution, though he shows deep loyalty to family and friends, willing to sacrifice himself for them. Goku's naivety and lack of emotional maturity persist, stemming from his isolated upbringing, but he demonstrates intuition in combat and growth through relationships, inspiring even gods and foes to evolve.

The series begins with the Battle of Gods arc, where Goku, having returned from the afterlife after the Buu Saga, trains under King Kai and faces the God of Destruction Beerus, who seeks the Super Saiyan God to prevent universal destruction. Goku achieves the Super Saiyan God transformation through a ritual involving his allies, including Vegeta and Gohan, allowing him to battle Beerus on equal footing. This form, with its red hair and divine ki, marks a pivotal power-up, emphasizing Goku's role in averting catastrophe while satisfying his battle lust. The fight ends in a draw, forging an alliance with Beerus, who spares Earth due to Goku's influence.

Subsequent arcs build on this. In the Resurrection 'F' arc, Frieza is resurrected and trains to surpass Goku, leading to a rematch. Goku, now mastering Super Saiyan Blue (a god ki-enhanced Super Saiyan form with blue hair), teams with Vegeta to defeat Frieza, highlighting their rivalry-turned-partnership. Goku's compassion shines as he respects Frieza's growth, though the tyrant betrays them.

The Universe 6 arc introduces a tournament against Universe 6, where Goku battles Hit, the assassin, pushing his limits and refining Super Saiyan Blue. He forms alliances with rivals like Vegeta, and his childlike innocence piques the interest of higher beings like Champa.

The Future Trunks arc pits Goku against Goku Black and Future Zamasu, fused as Fused Zamasu. Goku's righteous rage erupts upon learning of his family's murder in an alternate timeline, leading to intense battles and the introduction of Ultra Instinct -Sign, a state where his body moves autonomously. This showcases his development, as he regrets past immaturity and strives to make loved ones proud.

The Tournament of Power arc is a climax, with Goku assembling Universe 7's team, including a reluctant alliance with Frieza, to fight in a multiversal battle royale against erasure by Zeno. Goku fully awakens Ultra Instinct, a silver-haired form of perfect instinctual fighting, defeating Jiren of Universe 11. His philosophy of companionship inspires Jiren, turning a foe into a respectful ally, and Goku's determination saves his universe, though he acknowledges the risks of his decisions.

In the Broly movie arc, Goku encounters the legendary Saiyan Broly, embracing his heritage by sharing his birth name Kakarot. He trains with Vegeta under Whis, forming a bond with Broly as a mentor, helping control his power during their clash, which evolves into friendship.

The manga-exclusive Super Hero arc sees Goku training in Ultra Instinct while Gohan and Piccolo handle the main threat from Cell Max. Goku observes from afar, intervening minimally, reflecting his growth in trusting the next generation like Gohan and Goten. He continues refining forms under Whis, wearing gi with Whis' kanji, and maintains his simple goals of adventure and strength.

Throughout, Goku's transformations—Super Saiyan God, Blue, and Ultra Instinct—drive his character arc from a battle-obsessed warrior to one who balances personal joy with universal protection, often through alliances that highlight his inspirational effect on others.</p></strong>

        <h3>Vegeta</h3>
        <hr
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>
               In Dragon Ball Super, Vegeta, the proud prince of the fallen Saiyan race, evolves from a rival to Goku into a key protector of Earth and Universe 7, driven by his unyielding desire to surpass Goku while embracing family and alliances. His character development highlights a shift from arrogance and ruthlessness to a more balanced warrior who values morality, teamwork, and atonement for his past, though his ego and competitive nature persist.

The series begins with the Battle of Gods arc, where Beerus, the God of Destruction, arrives on Earth seeking a Super Saiyan God. Vegeta, initially terrified of Beerus after learning of his role in the Saiyan genocide, trains rigorously under Whis to close the power gap with Goku. His rage peaks when Beerus slaps Bulma at her birthday party, prompting Vegeta to attack the god in a fury-fueled outburst that temporarily boosts his power beyond Goku's. This event underscores his protective instincts toward his family, marking a turning point in his growth from self-interest to emotional depth. Vegeta achieves Super Saiyan God and later Super Saiyan Blue through training, but his pride leads to defeats, reinforcing his determination to prove Saiyan superiority.

In the Resurrection 'F' arc (Golden Frieza Saga), Vegeta allies with Goku against a revived Frieza, who has attained a golden form. Vegeta, having once served under Frieza, rejects rejoining him due to the genocide of his race, showcasing his evolved sense of justice. He battles Frieza alongside Goku, but their rivalry causes hesitation; Vegeta even spares Frieza briefly to gloat, allowing Frieza to destroy Earth. Revived via the Dragon Balls, Vegeta helps defeat Frieza, solidifying his role as Universe 7's defender. His relationship with Bulma deepens, as he prioritizes her safety, reflecting his softer side amid his warrior pride.

The Universe 6 arc introduces the Tournament of Destroyers, where Vegeta represents Universe 7 against Universe 6. He takes a mentor-like interest in Cabba, a young Saiyan, teaching him to become a Super Saiyan and expressing curiosity about his race's history— a rare display of passion beyond rivalry. Vegeta battles foes like Sadala's warriors, emphasizing fair fights and dignity, and vows to resurrect Universe 6 after its erasure, showing growing compassion. His tactical style shines, but arrogance leads to close calls, like underestimating opponents.

The Future Trunks arc (Goku Black/Zamasu Saga) sees Vegeta traveling to the future to aid his son against Goku Black and Zamasu. He protects Future Trunks, expressing pride in his strength and fury at Black for stealing Goku's form, highlighting his disdain for dishonorable tactics. Vegeta fuses with Goku via Potara earrings despite his pride's aversion to fusion, demonstrating willingness for alliances to safeguard family. His battles reveal his tactical intelligence and refusal to abandon values, even as he grapples with Goku's unique Ultra Instinct.

In the Tournament of Power arc, Vegeta fights in the multi-universe tournament to prevent Universe 7's erasure. He clashes with Jiren of Universe 11, pushing his limits to prove he's the strongest mortal, evolving to Super Saiyan Blue Evolution. Vegeta rejects unfair methods, insulting cowards like Prum, and supports Goku by donating energy for Ultra Instinct, admitting their blood demands individual combat yet valuing teamwork. His protective drive intensifies, motivated by thoughts of Bulma and his children during losses, and he sheds tears apologizing to Bulma for failing them, revealing profound emotional growth.

The Broly arc pits Vegeta against the Legendary Super Saiyan Broly on an icy planet. Donning winter gear over his armor, he initially fights defensively but taps into rage, achieving greater power. This alliance with Goku against a common threat reinforces his role as a defender, though his initial fear of Broly's might echoes past vulnerabilities.

In the Galactic Patrol Prisoner arc (Moro Saga), Vegeta trains on Yardrat, learning Spirit Control techniques like Instant Transmission. He atones for past atrocities on Namek by vowing to protect the Namekians from the energy-absorbing wizard Moro, expressing guilt over his ruthless history. Vegeta views Moro with disgust for stealing power unfairly, contrasting his preference for honorable battles. Despite defeats, his determination grows, accepting his villainous past and fighting for redemption.

The Granolah the Survivor arc culminates Vegeta's development. Training under Beerus, he masters Ultra Ego, a form fueled by destruction energy, symbolized by a golden earpiece. However, he notes he cannot fully abandon his morality to unleash its potential, indicating irreversible growth from cold-blooded killer to principled warrior. In battles against Granolah, Vegeta immerses in combat as his "happy place," yet prioritizes family and home, refusing to revert to his brutal origins. His obsession with surpassing Goku endures, but now it's tempered by respect, alliances, and a protective pride in his Saiyan heritage.

Throughout Super, Vegeta's personality blends arrogance, dry humor, and tactical brilliance with newfound compassion. He mocks enemies sarcastically, fears no one except threats to his family, and evolves from egotistical anti-hero to deuteragonist, reliably allying with the Z Fighters while pushing personal limits. His story arc emphasizes redemption, family bonds, and the thrill of battle, making him Universe 7's ultimate rival-turned-guardian.

        <h3>Gohan</h3>
        <hr>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>
              In Dragon Ball Super, Son Gohan, the half-Saiyan son of Goku and Chi-Chi, evolves from a scholarly family man who has largely abandoned fighting to a renewed protector of Earth, driven by threats to his loved ones. Unlike his father, Gohan lacks a passion for combat, preferring intellectual pursuits like becoming a professor, but he unleashes immense power when family is endangered. His personality remains humble, kind, and gentle-hearted, with a Saiyan appetite and a strong attachment to his mentor Piccolo, whom he views as a surrogate uncle. He is a devoted husband to Videl and doting father to Pan, often balancing family life with sporadic training. However, Gohan's flaw of becoming arrogant when powered up—evident in past battles—persists, though he works to overcome it through discipline.

The story begins in the Resurrection F arc, where Gohan has retired from fighting, becoming scrawny and out of shape while focusing on his career. He wears formal clothing like a grey collared shirt with a blue vest and red pants. When Frieza invades Earth seeking revenge, Gohan dons a green tracksuit and joins the battle. Witnessing Piccolo, Videl, and Pan seemingly killed by Frieza triggers his rage, leading to a Super Saiyan transformation and a powerful Kamehameha that aids in Frieza's defeat (later undone by Whis' Temporal Do-Over). This event motivates Gohan to resume training with Piccolo, reconditioning his body to muscular form and slicking back his hair. He also returns to his Great Saiyaman alter ego to fight crime discreetly, protecting his identity while enjoying superhuman feats, though he dislikes fame.

Key alliances form with Piccolo, who trains him rigorously, and family members like Videl and Pan, who support his heroism. In a side event, while working as a stunt double for actor Barry Kahn in a Great Saiyaman film, Gohan's identity is exposed, leading to blackmail and a confrontation. Barry, possessed by the alien Watagash, kidnaps Pan, forcing Gohan to become Super Great Saiyaman. He defeats the possessed Barry, separating him from Watagash, showcasing his protective instincts and bond with his family, who trust in his abilities.

Leading into the Tournament of Power arc, Gohan's training enhances his power, making him comparable to Goku. He admits his Saiyan side excites him during challenges, like the Zeno Expo against Top of Universe 11, but Piccolo warns against arrogance. Goku appoints Gohan as Team Universe 7's captain, praising his intellect and leadership. Gohan excels, devising on-the-spot strategies to defeat opponents, earning compliments even from Frieza. He fights in a gi similar to his past ones, removing glasses in battle, and focuses on empowering his natural potential rather than Super Saiyan forms, evolving as an individual beyond his Saiyan heritage.

In the Super Hero arc, Gohan is deeply immersed in scholarly work on "Sai-ants," isolating himself in casual attire like a white henley and black joggers, neglecting training and family duties to Piccolo's frustration. When the Red Ribbon Army resurfaces with threats like Cell Max, Piccolo forcefully outfits him in purple Demon Clothes. Gohan transforms into his Ultimate form and ultimately Beast form, a wild, messy-haired state of immense power. He overcomes his arrogance flaw, decisively defeating Cell Max without hesitation, protecting Earth and demonstrating growth in balancing his scholar life with warrior duties. Throughout, Gohan's role emphasizes defense over conquest, allying with Z Fighters while prioritizing family, solidifying his as a pivotal, reluctant hero.

        <h3>Piccolo</h3>
        <hr>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>
               Piccolo, the Namekian reincarnation of King Piccolo and later the reunified Nameless Namekian after fusing with Kami, plays a pivotal role as a wise, tactical warrior and key member of the Dragon Team in Dragon Ball Super. His personality remains stern, grumpy, and analytical, with a cocky edge in battle, but evolves to show greater compassion, especially toward Gohan and Pan, blending his pragmatic, confrontational nature with nurturing traits. He enjoys solitude, meditation, and precise strategies, often devising effective plans by exploiting opponents' weaknesses. By this era, all traces of his original villainous tendencies have vanished, replaced by a protective loyalty to Earth and its defenders.

In the Universe 6 arc, Piccolo supports the team during the tournament against Universe 6, showcasing his tactical mind. He trains with Goku and others to prepare, highlighting his growth into a reliable ally. His bond with Gohan deepens, as he encourages the scholar's return to fighting when needed. Piccolo's Namekian heritage, including fusions with Nail and Kami, grants him enhanced power, wisdom, and cultural understanding, making him a bridge between Earth's fighters and broader cosmic threats. He fuses no new times here but relies on his established abilities, such as ki manipulation and regeneration, to contribute to alliances against rivals like Hit and Cabba.

Progressing through subsequent arcs, Piccolo's character development emphasizes mentorship and selflessness. In the "Future Trunks" arc, he aids in battles against Goku Black and Zamasu, allying with the Z Fighters to protect timelines. His analytical skills shine in devising strategies, and he shows distress over destruction, as seen in his reaction to threats against the Lookout. Personality-wise, he remains indifferent to romance but displays joy in social events like Bulma's parties and Gohan's wedding, occasionally relaxing his stern demeanor.

In the Universe Survival arc, Piccolo competes in the Tournament of Power, representing Universe 7 alongside Android 17 and Frieza in a temporary alliance. He battles warriors from other universes, using his cunning to outmaneuver foes like the Trio de Dangers. Key events include his teamwork with Gohan, reinforcing their uncle-nephew-like bond, and his pride in Gohan's growth. Piccolo's tactical prowess helps secure Universe 7's victory, underscoring his evolution from rival to indispensable hero. He vows to protect loved ones, echoing his sacrificial history, like dying for Gohan against Nappa.

The Broly arc sees Piccolo allying with Goku and Vegeta against the Legendary Super Saiyan, providing strategic support without major solo battles. His role highlights his role as a grounded advisor, urging caution amid escalating powers.

Culminating in the Super Hero arc, Piccolo undergoes significant transformation and development. Sensing danger from the revived Red Ribbon Army, he infiltrates their base in a soldier disguise (numbered 94, a nod to Pan's nickname "Piccoyo"). He faces Cell Max, a bio-engineered monstrosity, and achieves the Orange Piccolo form—a massive, orange-skinned transformation boosting his power immensely, allowing him to hold off the beast. This form represents his deepest growth, combining Namekian potential with Kami's divine wisdom. In a major battle, Piccolo teams with Gohan (in Beast form) to defeat Cell Max, sacrificing momentarily but surviving. His alliance with Gohan is central, as he retrains the reluctant fighter, using harsh methods to restore his instincts. Piccolo's nurturing side emerges fully with Pan, whom he raises efficiently—singing to her at night, playing peek-a-boo secretly, and teaching martial arts. He proudly accepts Gohan's request for retraining post-Frieza threats, emphasizing protection of family. This arc cements Piccolo's joyful, silly undertones amid stress, while his compassion extends to all life, horrified by extinctions like Super Buu's human attack. Overall, from Universe 6 to Super Hero, Piccolo transitions from tactical supporter to transformative mentor, his alliances and battles reinforcing his permanent heroism and deep bonds.

        <h3>Frieza</h3>
        <hr>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>
              Frieza, the ruthless emperor of Universe 7 and descendant of Chilled, son of King Cold, and brother to Cooler, reemerges as a major antagonist in Dragon Ball Super following his defeat on Namek. In the Resurrection F arc (adapting the movie Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’), Frieza is revived by his subordinate Sorbet using Earth's Dragon Balls. Obsessed with revenge against Goku for his past humiliation, Frieza undergoes four months of intense training in a Hyperbolic Time Chamber equivalent, unlocking a new transformation: Golden Frieza, his final form enhanced with a golden hue. This form vastly increases his power, allowing him to match Super Saiyan Blue Goku. However, due to impatience and lack of mastery, Frieza's stamina drains rapidly during their battle on Earth. He destroys the planet in a final act of rage but is ultimately defeated by Goku's Kamehameha, reduced to ashes. Frieza's personality remains sadistic and egomaniacal, reveling in destruction and mocking foes, though his revival reveals a newfound willingness to train, marking initial character development from his previously untrained arrogance.

Frieza's role expands in the Golden Frieza Saga, where he returns via meditation in Hell, perfecting his Golden form into True Golden Frieza for better control and endurance. He invades Earth again, seeking the Dragon Balls for immortality, but is thwarted by Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan Blue forms. Despite his defeat, Frieza's tactical brilliance shines as he briefly overpowers the Saiyans before his form's limitations resurface. His cruelty is evident in torturing Gohan with Death Beams, echoing his PTSD-induced rage from past losses, yet he shows calculated patience by prioritizing power over immediate vengeance.

In the Universe Survival Saga (Tournament of Power), Frieza is temporarily revived by Goku for one day as an uneasy ally for Universe 7's team. Despite his heartless sociopathy and disdain for Goku, Frieza fights alongside the Z-Fighters, forming effective tag-teams with Gohan and Goku against opponents like Jiren from Universe 11. He demonstrates synchronized combat, donating energy to the Universe 7 Spirit Bomb and saving Goku with a ki transfer to enable Ultra Instinct. Frieza betrays Universe 9 assassins hired by their gods, showcasing his opportunistic nature and lack of loyalty, even offering to join them for revival. His composed demeanor returns, with refined Golden Frieza allowing him to eliminate foes efficiently. Post-tournament, Whis fully revives him for "good behavior," and Frieza develops reluctant respect for Goku's strength, celebrating briefly with the team while vowing future dominance. This alliance highlights subtle growth: from pure malice to pragmatic cooperation, though his narcissism persists, as he slights deities like Zeno and aims to overthrow the Omni-Kings.

In the Broly arc, Frieza allies with Paragus to exploit Broly's Legendary Super Saiyan potential, tricking Broly into rage by killing Paragus. However, Golden Frieza is overwhelmed by Broly's power, forcing retreat. Learning from past errors, Frieza avoids immortality wishes due to Hell's torturous experience and spares defectors Cheelai and Lemo, hoping they tame Broly for future subordination—contrasting his earlier Saiyan genocide driven by fear of Super Saiyans.

The Granolah arc sees Frieza's ultimate evolution: after a decade in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, he achieves Black Frieza, a sleek black variant of his true form, granting god-like power. He effortlessly defeats Gas (empowered by Dragon Balls) and both Ultra Instinct Goku and Ultra Ego Vegeta in one-sided battles, showcasing overwhelming dominance. Frieza spares them, uninterested in immediate conquest, emphasizing his evolved patience and supremacy complex. Throughout, Frieza's traits—sadism, perfectionism, dark humor, and family pride without attachment—drive his actions, evolving from vengeful tyrant to a calculated overlord who trains rigorously, forms temporary alliances, and pursues universal rule, clashing repeatedly with Goku while rebuilding the Frieza Force to control over 70% of Universe 7.

        <h3>Jiren</h3>
        <hr>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><strong>
               Jiren, known as Jiren the Gray, is the most powerful member of the Pride Troopers from Universe 11, considered one of the strongest mortals in the multiverse, surpassing even his universe's God of Destruction, Belmod. He serves as the main fighting antagonist in the Universe Survival Saga, particularly as a major contestant in the Tournament of Power, a high-stakes battle royale among universes for the Super Dragon Balls, where the loser's universe faces erasure.

Jiren's motivations stem from a traumatic childhood marked by profound losses. His family and loved ones were murdered, and he experienced betrayal from those he trusted, leading to a deep-seated fear of defeat and reliance on others. This drove him to devote his life to absolute justice in Universe 11, believing that only unmatched strength can achieve it. He seeks to use the Super Dragon Balls to resurrect his old master, Gicchin, who died fighting the killer of his parents—a wish so vital that Jiren temporarily sets aside his principles against causing other universes' destruction to participate in the tournament. Despite his duty to protect Universe 11, he initially refuses entry, prioritizing justice over survival, but joins upon insistence from leader Top, vowing to leave if any threat arises there.

Jiren is stoic, serious, quiet, and honorable, speaking only when necessary and rarely posing or engaging in frivolity like his teammates. He is brave, disciplined, focused, and observant, constantly studying threats while acting only when essential. Devoted to justice without selfish motives, he never kills villains, preferring to capture them, and shows disgust toward killers or those abandoning justice, mocking assassin Hit's "honor" as rubbish. Proud and confident to the point of arrogance, Jiren fights alone, refusing allies' help even under pressure, and lets opponents attack first to demonstrate superiority. His solitary nature, haunted by past betrayals, makes him distrust teamwork, viewing allies' falls as mere job fulfillment. However, he respects worthy foes like Goku and Vegeta for exceeding expectations without losing identity, applauding their growth. When truly challenged, he becomes rattled, savage, and erratic, prioritizing victory above all, as losing equates to reliving past failures. Deep down, he fears defeat and enjoys battles that draw out his full potential, smiling at Goku's decisive blows. His views oppose Goku's emphasis on bonds, leading to internal conflict, but he shows honor by refusing underhanded wins and ultimately learns to value trust.

Jiren possesses extraordinary power, with immense physical strength, speed, and durability that outclass gods. His race from Universe 11 features high battle potential, marked by a large, sleek head, gray skin, large black eyes, and a muscular build. He wears the Pride Trooper uniform: a red spandex suit with black accents, white gloves, and boots. In combat, he employs ki-based attacks, energy blasts, and forms like Super Full Power, which amplifies his might to devastating levels. He meditates to maintain focus and can power up massively when enraged, firing overwhelming energy bursts. Jiren's confidence allows him to counter ultimate techniques effortlessly, but he is vulnerable when caught off-guard, as with Hit's Time Prison or Android 17's strikes.

In the Tournament of Power, Jiren remains stationary initially, intervening only against berserk Kale to end her rampage. He single-handedly dominates, eliminating foes like Maji-Kayo after bluntly ordering Top aside. Against Hit, he breaks free from Time Prison and eliminates him after a fierce clash. Jiren battles Vegeta, dodging high-speed punches and earning respect for the Saiyan's resolve, but overpowers him. His pivotal confrontation is with Goku, starting as adversaries where Jiren mocks Goku's bonds but grows rattled by Goku's growth. Goku's Ultra Instinct pushes Jiren to full power, leading to savage exchanges; Jiren temporarily abandons honor, attempting to kill Goku's allies to disprove trust's value. After Goku's Perfected Ultra Instinct dominates, Jiren is beaten but refuses to eliminate the exhausted Goku unfairly, only relenting under Belmod's urging for the wish. In the final moments, Frieza and Android 17 aid Goku, defeating Jiren. Post-defeat, with Universe 11 resurrected, Jiren accepts loss honorably, smiling at Goku's challenge for a rematch and realizing the value of connections through Top's encouragement. He subconsciously bonds with Pride Troopers, vowing to grow stronger with friends for future victories, marking his character development from isolated strength-worshiper to one open to trust and teamwork.
